# Phase 4B: Copy Rewrites & Content Alignment

**Document Purpose:** Proposed copy rewrites for "Honest Beta" positioning  
**Date:** January 24, 2026  
**Status:** Awaiting Approval (No Implementation Yet)  
**Depends On:** [PHASE_3_STRUCTURE_AND_EXECUTION_PLAN.md](./PHASE_3_STRUCTURE_AND_EXECUTION_PLAN.md)

---

## Overview

This document proposes rewritten copy for all major sections of the AbiliLife landing page. Each rewrite is designed to:

- Be clear, simple, and grounded in pilot reality
- Avoid buzzwords, overpromising, and vague ecosystem language
- Distinguish "Mobility pilot" from the future super app vision
- Build trust through honest, specific communication

**DO NOT IMPLEMENT** until approved by founders.

---

## Section 1: Hero Section

### Current Copy (PROBLEMS):

| Element | Current Text | Problem |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Headline** | "Reimagining Inclusive Services" | Generic, buzzword-heavy, doesn't explain what AbiliLife is |
| **Subheadline** | "We are building a super app ecosystem where Persons with Disabilities and caregivers can access essential services with dignity and ease." | Overpromises ("super app ecosystem"), doesn't mention Mobility specifically |
| **Trust Indicators** | "Community-First Approach" + "5 Essential Service Branches" | Misleading (only 1 branch active) |
| **CTA** | Commented out (no active CTA) | No clear action for users |

### Proposed Copy (SOLUTION):

#### Headline:
```
Accessible Rides for Wheelchair Users in Nairobi
```

**Why it works:**
- Crystal clear what the product is (no "reimagining" abstraction)
- Specifies audience (wheelchair users)
- Specifies location (Nairobi)
- No buzzwords

**Alternative (if slightly broader scope preferred):**
```
Helping Wheelchair Users Find Accessible Transport in Nairobi
```

---

#### Subheadline:
```
We're testing a new way to request wheelchair-accessible rides. Join our pilot program — share your needs, connect with accessible vehicles, and help us build something better.
```

**Why it works:**
- Honest about pilot status ("we're testing")
- Clear value prop ("request wheelchair-accessible rides")
- Invites participation ("join our pilot")
- Sets expectation of co-creation ("help us build")
- No "super app" language

**Alternative (more concise):**
```
AbiliLife Mobility is an early-stage pilot helping wheelchair users in Nairobi request accessible rides through our partner network.
```

---

#### Primary CTA Button:
```
Try the Mobility Pilot
```

**Link destination:** `https://wa.me/254742560540?text=Hi, I'd like to try the AbiliLife Mobility pilot` (WhatsApp pre-filled message)

**Why it works:**
- Clear, action-oriented
- Explicitly says "pilot" (manages expectations)
- Direct path to human contact

---

#### Secondary CTA Button:
```
See How It Works
```

**Action:** Smooth scroll to `#how-it-works` section

**Why it works:**
- Allows exploration without commitment
- Standard web pattern (scroll to learn more)

---

#### Trust Indicators (Revised):
```
✓ Pilot Phase — Nairobi, Kenya
✓ Community-Built
```

**Why it works:**
- Geographic clarity (Nairobi, not "Africa")
- "Pilot Phase" is honest, not apologetic
- "Community-Built" (not "Community-First Approach") is more humble
- Removed "5 Essential Service Branches" (misleading)

---

## Section 2: How It Works

### Current Copy (PROBLEMS):

| Element | Current Text | Problem |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Section Title** | "How AbiliLife Mobility Works (Ongoing Beta)" | "Ongoing Beta" is vague |
| **Intro** | "Our transport module... designed to make travel easier and safer..." | "Module" implies ecosystem; doesn't explain pilot flow |
| **Step 2 Description** | "Book instantly through our accessible app or call our 24/7 support line" | Overpromises ("instantly," "24/7" unverified) |
| **Step 2 Details** | "One-tap booking, Voice commands, Large button interface, Multi-language support" | Features that may not exist |
| **Step 3 Description** | "Board your ramp-equipped vehicle while caregivers receive real-time updates" | Implies tracking exists |
| **Step 3 Details** | "GPS tracking, Arrival notifications, Safety check-ins, Emergency SOS button" | Features that don't exist |
| **Bottom CTA** | "See Demo" + "App Coming soon to Google Play and Apple App Store" | App store claim unverified |

### Proposed Copy (SOLUTION):

#### Section Title:
```
How It Works — Mobility Pilot
```

**Why it works:**
- Removes vague "Ongoing Beta"
- Clear that this is the Mobility pilot (not full platform)

---

#### Intro Paragraph:
```
AbiliLife Mobility helps wheelchair users request accessible rides in Nairobi. Here's how the pilot works:
```

**Why it works:**
- Direct, no fluff
- Reinforces Nairobi geography
- Clear it's a pilot

---

#### Step 1: Set Your Preferences

**Title:** `Set Your Preferences` *(keep)*

**Description:**
```
Tell us about your accessibility needs — wheelchair type, transfer assistance, communication preferences. We save this so you don't repeat it every time.
```

**Details (Revised):**
- Wheelchair type & size
- Transfer assistance needs
- Communication preferences
- Emergency contacts

**Why it works:**
- Practical, specific language ("so you don't repeat it")
- Removed vague "mobility aid requirements"

---

#### Step 2: Request a Ride

**Title:** `Request a Ride` *(keep)*

**Description:**
```
Share your pickup and drop-off locations with us. We'll connect you with an accessible vehicle through our partner network.
```

**Details (Revised):**
- Enter pickup location
- Enter destination
- Add any trip notes
- Submit your request

**Why it works:**
- Honest about process ("we'll connect you")
- Acknowledges partner model
- Removed false claims ("one-tap booking," "voice commands," "instant")

---

#### Step 3: Travel with Peace of Mind

**Title:** `Travel with Peace of Mind` *(changed from "Travel Safely")*

**Description:**
```
Board your wheelchair-accessible vehicle. You can share trip details with your caregiver or family via WhatsApp.
```

**Details (Revised):**
- Accessible vehicle arrives
- Share details with caregivers
- Rate your experience
- Provide feedback

**Why it works:**
- "Peace of Mind" is softer than "Safely" (doesn't overpromise safety)
- Acknowledges WhatsApp sharing (actual capability)
- Removed all false tracking claims
- Includes "feedback" (reinforces pilot nature)

---

#### Bottom CTA Section:

**CTA Button:**
```
Try the Mobility Pilot
```

**Supporting Text:**
```
Ready to test AbiliLife Mobility? Chat with us on WhatsApp.
```

**Why it works:**
- Removes app store claim
- Sets WhatsApp expectation
- Removed "See Demo" (pending GIF verification decision)

## Section 3: Problem Context (formerly Problem-Solution)

### Current Copy (PROBLEMS):

| Element | Current Text | Problem |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Section ID** | `#challenge-solution` | Anchor doesn't match nav |
| **Left Title** | "The Challenge We're Solving" | Fine |
| **Statistics** | "80%, 30%, 50%, 70%, 100K+" | No sources cited |
| **Right Title** | "Our Solution 🧪" | Emoji is casual; "Solution" overstates pilot |
| **Right Intro** | "AbiliLife provides a comprehensive ecosystem..." | Returns to ecosystem language |
| **Solution Card** | "Book wheelchair-accessible vehicles with just a few taps" | Overpromises (not "few taps") |
| **Solution Card** | "Our team is available around the clock" (24/7 claim) | Unverified |
| **Solution Card** | "All vehicles are equipped... and trained drivers" | Implies we own vehicles/drivers |

### Proposed Copy (SOLUTION):

#### Section ID:
```
id="problem"
```

**Why:** Matches nav anchor from Phase 4A

---

#### Left Side: The Problem

**Title:** `The Challenge` *(simplified)*

**Intro Paragraph:**
```
Wheelchair users in Kenya face daily transportation barriers that limit work, healthcare access, and independence.
```

**Statistics (Revised):**

**Option A (If sources can be cited):**
Keep current stats with citations:
```
80%* — of wheelchair users report transport challenges
[*Source: Kenya National Survey on Persons with Disabilities, 2022]
```

**Option B (If sources CANNOT be cited — RECOMMENDED):**
Replace with qualitative framing:

```
Instead of statistics cards, use a simple list:

Many wheelchair users in Nairobi face:
• Public transport that isn't wheelchair-accessible
• Difficulty finding reliable, affordable rides
• Safety concerns during travel
• Lost opportunities due to mobility barriers
```

**Why Option B works:**
- No false precision (unverified percentages)
- Relatable, specific problems
- No risk of misleading claims

---

#### Right Side: Our Approach

**Title:** `Our Approach` *(changed from "Our Solution 🧪")*

**Intro Paragraph:**
```
AbiliLife Mobility is an early-stage pilot testing whether better ride-request tools can reduce some of these barriers. We're starting small in Nairobi, learning as we go.
```

**Why it works:**
- "Approach" (not "Solution") is humbler
- Explicit pilot framing
- "Testing whether" is honest
- "Starting small" manages expectations
- "Learning as we go" invites participation

---

**Solution Cards (Revised):**

**Card 1:**
```
Title: Partner Network
Icon: MapPin
Description: We connect you with accessible transport providers in Nairobi who operate wheelchair-friendly vehicles.
```

**Card 2:**
```
Title: Community-Driven
Icon: Users
Description: Built with feedback from wheelchair users in Kenya. Your input shapes what we build next.
```

**Card 3:**
```
Title: WhatsApp-Friendly
Icon: Phone
Description: Don't want an app? You can request rides and get updates via WhatsApp.
```

**Card 4:**
```
Title: Transparent Pilot
Icon: Shield (or Eye icon)
Description: We're honest about what works and what doesn't. This is a test, not a perfect product.
```

**Why these work:**
- Removed "24/7 support" (unverified)
- Removed "trained drivers" / "our vehicles" (partner operates)
- Removed "few taps" (overpromise)
- Added "Transparent Pilot" (builds trust through honesty)
- WhatsApp card acknowledges actual workflow

---

**Bottom CTA:**

**Button Text:**
```
Learn How It Works
```

**Action:** Scroll to `#how-it-works`

**Why it works:**
- Less aggressive than "More About Our Platform"
- Clear next step

## Section 4: Vision Teaser (replaces Ecosystem)

### Current Copy (PROBLEMS):

| Element | Current Text | Problem |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Section ID** | `#ecosystem` | Wrong anchor |
| **Title** | "Growing Digital Ecosystem" | Implies all modules are growing |
| **Intro** | "...not just a single app, but a comprehensive digital ecosystem... across Africa" | Overpromises breadth and geography |
| **Visual** | Full tree with 5 module cards, status badges | Misleading (4 modules frozen) |
| **Module Cards** | Detailed descriptions with "Ongoing Beta" / "Upcoming Beta" badges | "Upcoming Beta" implies active development |
| **Bottom Box** | "Building the Future..." + CTA to demo | Too grand, implies shipping soon |

### Proposed Copy (SOLUTION):

This section should be **completely replaced** with a minimal "Vision Teaser" component.

#### Section ID:
```
id="vision"
```

---

#### Section Title:
```
Where We're Headed
```

**Alternative:**
```
Beyond Mobility — Our Vision
```

**Why it works:**
- Simple, aspirational but not promissory
- "Where We're Headed" (future, not present)

---

#### Body Copy:
```
Right now, we're focused on getting Mobility right. But transport is just the first step.

In the future, we envision a platform that helps persons with disabilities access:
• Healthcare services (AbiliLife Care)
• Employment opportunities (AbiliLife Work)
• Assistive devices (AbiliLife Access)
• Educational resources (AbiliLife Learn)

These are explorations, not promises. Mobility comes first.
```

**Why it works:**
- "Right now, we're focused on..." anchors in present reality
- "In the future" clearly labels as aspirational
- Simple bullet list (not module cards)
- "Explorations, not promises" is radically honest
- Final line re-anchors to Mobility

---

#### Visual Design:

**DO NOT USE:**
- Tree visualization
- Module cards with descriptions
- Status badges
- Icons (optional: keep very subtle)

**DO USE:**
- Simple text-based list
- Minimal padding/whitespace
- Gray text (not purple) to de-emphasize
- Optional fade-in animation

---

### Full Vision Teaser Section (Proposed):

```
[Section ID: vision]
[Background: Light gray or white, NOT prominent]

[Title — centered]
Where We're Headed

[Body Copy — centered, max-width ~700px]
Right now, we're focused on getting Mobility right. But transport is just the first step.

In the future, we envision a platform that helps persons with disabilities access:
• Healthcare services (AbiliLife Care)
• Employment opportunities (AbiliLife Work)
• Assistive devices (AbiliLife Access)
• Educational resources (AbiliLife Learn)

These are explorations, not promises. Mobility comes first.

[No CTA button — just text]
```

**Alternative Minimal Version (Even Simpler):**

```
[Small centered section, ~400px wide]

Beyond Mobility

Mobility is our starting point. Over time, we hope to explore healthcare access, employment, education, and more. But first, we need to prove we can help wheelchair users get around Nairobi.
```

## Section 5: Team Section

### Current Copy (STATUS):

The Team section is **mostly fine** but needs minor bio review.

---

#### Team Member Bios (Audit):

**Kevin's Bio:**
> "Business strategist and Co-founder who drives our vision and growth, while actively contributing to product development and innovation..."

**Issue:** "drives our vision and growth" is vague  
**Proposed Revision:**
```
Co-Founder leading partnerships and business development for AbiliLife. Kevin connects the team with mobility providers, community organizations, and early pilot users in Nairobi.
```

**Why it works:** Specific, grounded, relevant to pilot

---

**Eli's Bio:**
> "Software Engineer passionate about building impactful, inclusive tech for underserved communities. Leads product design and MVP development at AbiliLife..."

**Status:** **Good** — mentions MVP, doesn't overpromise

**Minor tweak (optional):**
```
Software Engineer leading product and development. Eli builds AbiliLife Mobility's user experience, focusing on accessibility and community input.
```

---

**Philip's Bio:**
> "Frontend developer and Software Engineer, passionate about building accessible, user-centered web applications. Inspired by real-world accessibility challenges, Philip creates responsive, inclusive interfaces..."

**Status:** **Good** — grounded, doesn't overpromise

**Keep as-is** or minor tweak:
```
Frontend developer and co-founder building AbiliLife's interfaces. Philip focuses on accessible design and has led projects addressing digital barriers for persons with disabilities.
```

---

**Liban's Bio:**
> "Aspiring fullstack developer passionate about solving real-world problems with innovative solutions. Liban leads strategic partnerships, team engagement, and event planning..."

**Issue:** "Aspiring" may undercut credibility  
**Proposed Revision:**
```
Co-Founder managing partnerships and community engagement. Liban connects AbiliLife with disability rights organizations, pilot testers, and strategic partners in Kenya.
```

**Why it works:** Removes "aspiring," clarifies role

---

#### Section Title & Intro:

**Current Title:**
> "The Team Behind AbiliLife"

**Status:** **Good** — keep

**Current Intro:**
> "Meet the passionate individuals dedicated to improving accessibility and independence for persons with disabilities across Africa."

**Issue:** "across Africa" (pilot is Nairobi)  
**Proposed Revision:**
```
Meet the team building AbiliLife Mobility. We're based in Nairobi and working with the disability community to test new ways to improve transport access.
```

**Why it works:**
- Removes "passionate individuals" (buzzword)
- Anchors in Nairobi
- Clear about pilot focus
- "With the community" (not "for")

---

### Full Team Section Copy (Proposed):

```

## Summary: Copy Principles Applied

| Principle | How We Applied It |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Clarity** | "Accessible Rides for Wheelchair Users in Nairobi" (not "Reimagining Inclusive Services") |
| **Honesty** | "Early-stage pilot," "testing whether," "learning as we go" |
| **Specificity** | Nairobi (not "Africa"), wheelchair users (not "PWDs"), partner network (not "our drivers") |
| **Humility** | "Our Approach" (not "Our Solution"), "Explorations, not promises" |
| **Action-Oriented** | "Try the Mobility Pilot" (not "Learn More" or "See Demo") |
| **No Buzzwords** | Removed "super app ecosystem," "reimagining," "comprehensive," "empowering" |
| **No Overpromising** | Removed "GPS tracking," "one-tap booking," "24/7 support," "instant," "across Africa" |

---

## Before Implementation: Founder Decisions Required

| Decision | Current Blocker | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| **CTA Destination** | WhatsApp link format | Confirm phone number and message text |
| **Statistics Sources** | Can't cite 80%, 30%, etc. | Use qualitative framing (Option B above) |
| **24/7 Support** | Unverified | Remove claim |
| **Demo Modal** | GIFs may be outdated | Remove entirely (or verify + reframe) |
| **Ace Mobility Naming** | Should we name partner? | Leaning toward "partner network" (anonymous) |

---

## Next Steps

1. **Founder Review:** Approve/revise proposed copy
2. **Copy Finalization:** Lock in approved text
3. **Phase 4C Implementation:** Code changes to implement approved copy
4. **QA:** Visual review, mobile test, accessibility audit
