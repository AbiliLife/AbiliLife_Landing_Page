## CTA Strategy (Updated)

### CTA Hierarchy

| Priority | CTA | Target | Placement |
|----------|-----|--------|-----------|
| **Primary** | Download the Pilot App (APK) | APK download link (EAS/Google Drive) | Hero, Pilot section, Final CTA |
| **Secondary A** | Join User Testing | Google Form (End Users) | Pilot section, Final CTA |
| **Secondary B** | Partner With Us | Google Form (Organizations) | Footer, possibly Final CTA |
| **Tertiary** | Chat on WhatsApp | WhatsApp support | Footer only (support channel) |

### CTA Rules

- **Max 2 CTAs per section** (avoid clutter)
- **Hero:** Primary only (APK download)
- **Pilot section:** Primary + Secondary A (APK + User Form)
- **Final CTA:** Primary + Secondary A
- **Footer:** Secondary B + Tertiary (Partner Form + WhatsApp support)
- **WhatsApp is NOT the main conversion path** — it's for support/questions only

### APK Expectation Setting

Users should understand:
- This is an **Android APK** (not on Play Store yet)
- Requires **manual installation** (sideloading)
- This is **early-stage testing**, not a polished product
- They may need to enable "Install from unknown sources"

---

## Design Philosophy

Inspired by [msossi.com](https://msossi.com/) — clean, calm, one dominant color, immediate clarity.

**Core Principle:** A first-time visitor should understand what AbiliLife is, who it's for, and what to do next within 15 seconds.

---

## Page Structure (Top to Bottom)

### Section 1: Hero
**Purpose:** First impression. Answer "What is this?" instantly.

| Element | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Headline** | One clear sentence about what AbiliLife does |
| **Subheadline** | One supporting sentence about the pilot |
| **Primary CTA** | "Download the Pilot App" → APK download link |
| **Visual** | One hero image (wheelchair user + accessible vehicle) |
| **Trust Badge** | "Pilot Phase — Nairobi, Kenya" |
| **Platform Note** | Small text: "Android APK • Early Access" |

**Design Notes:**
- Full-width section
- Minimal text (under 30 words total)
- CTA button prominent, high contrast
- No carousel, no animation
- Mobile: image below text
- **Only 1 CTA in Hero** (APK download)

---

### Section 2: The Problem
**Purpose:** Validate the pain point. Build emotional connection.

| Element | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Section Title** | "The Problem" (simple, direct) |
| **Problem Statement** | 2-3 sentences on transport barriers for wheelchair users in Kenya |
| **Visual Evidence** | Optional: single illustration or photo |

**Design Notes:**
- Short, punchy copy
- No statistics (unless verified and cited)
- Empathy-driven, not data-driven
- Subtle background color shift to break visual monotony

---

### Section 3: The Pilot — AbiliLife Mobility
**Purpose:** Explain what we're actually building and testing right now.

| Element | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Section Title** | "AbiliLife Mobility" or "Our Pilot" |
| **Explanation** | What the mobility pilot is, how it works (3 steps max) |
| **How It Works** | Simple numbered list or icon row |
| **Current Status** | Clear "Pilot Phase" label |
| **Primary CTA** | "Download the Pilot App" → APK link |
| **Secondary CTA** | "Join User Testing" → Google Form (Users) |

**Design Notes:**
- This is the core product section
- Clean step-by-step visual (1, 2, 3)
- No false claims (GPS tracking, 24/7 support, etc.)
- Honest language: "We're testing...", "Join the pilot..."
- **Max 2 CTAs** (APK + User Form)

---

### Section 3b: How to Join the Pilot (Sub-Section)
**Purpose:** Remove friction by explaining the onboarding process clearly.

**Recommendation:** Include as a **sub-block within Section 3** (not a standalone section). This keeps the pilot flow cohesive and avoids fragmenting the page.

| Element | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Sub-Section Title** | "How to Join" or "Get Started in 3 Steps" |
| **Step 1** | Download the APK (with install guidance) |
| **Step 2** | Fill out the quick signup form |
| **Step 3** | We'll follow up to onboard you |

**Design Notes:**
- Visually distinct but nested under Section 3
- Simple numbered steps (1, 2, 3)
- Include brief note: "Android only • Manual install required"
- Link to APK + Link to Google Form
- Optional: Collapsible "Need help installing?" FAQ

---

### Section 4: The Vision (Roadmap Teaser)
**Purpose:** Show future ambition without overpromising.

| Element | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Section Title** | "Where We're Headed" or "The Bigger Picture" |
| **Body Copy** | 2-3 sentences on the super app vision |
| **Future Modules** | Simple text list: Care, Work, Access, Learn |
| **Disclaimer** | "These are explorations, not promises. Mobility comes first." |

**Design Notes:**
- Minimal visual treatment (no module cards, no icons)
- Gray or muted text to de-emphasize
- Clear future framing ("In time...", "We envision...")
- No CTAs in this section

---

### Section 5: The Team
**Purpose:** Build trust through human faces and credibility.

| Element | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Section Title** | "The Team" or "Who We Are" |
| **Team Grid** | 4 co-founders with photo, name, role, 1-line bio |
| **Social Links** | LinkedIn only (simplify) |

**Design Notes:**
- Circular or rounded square photos
- Consistent sizing
- Short bios (under 20 words each)
- No "passionate individuals" fluff
- Mobile: 2x2 grid or single column

---

### Section 6: Call to Action (Final CTA)
**Purpose:** Close the page with a clear ask.

| Element | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Headline** | "Ready to try accessible transport in Nairobi?" |
| **Primary CTA** | "Download the Pilot App" → APK link |
| **Secondary CTA** | "Join User Testing" → Google Form |
| **Alternative** | Text link: "Questions? Chat with us on WhatsApp" |

**Design Notes:**
- High-contrast background (brand color)
- Large primary button (APK download)
- Secondary button or text link for form
- WhatsApp as text link only (not a button)
- This is the "bottom of funnel" moment
- **Max 2 prominent CTAs** + 1 text link

---

### Section 7: Footer
**Purpose:** Practical links and legal.

| Element | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Logo** | AbiliLife logo |
| **Contact Info** | Phone, Email, WhatsApp (support) |
| **Partner CTA** | "Partner With Us" → Google Form (Organizations) |
| **Social Links** | Twitter, Instagram |
| **Quick Links** | Back to top, maybe privacy (if applicable) |
| **Copyright** | © 2026 AbiliLife. All rights reserved. |

**Design Notes:**
- Simple, single-row or two-column layout
- Dark background (footer contrast)
- No heavy graphics
- Partner inquiry link lives here (not cluttering main page)
- WhatsApp positioned as support channel, not primary CTA
