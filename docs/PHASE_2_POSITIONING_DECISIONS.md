# Phase 2: Positioning & Truth Alignment Decisions

**Document Purpose:** Strategic decisions for landing page positioning  
**Date:** January 24, 2026  
**Status:** Decision Phase (No Implementation Yet)  
**Depends On:** [LANDING_PAGE_ANALYSIS.md](./LANDING_PAGE_ANALYSIS.md)

---

## Context Recap

Before Demo Day (February 6, 2026), the landing page must communicate AbiliLife's actual state without overpromising. The core tension:

| What We Want to Say | What Is True |
|---------------------|--------------|
| "Super app ecosystem" | Single-module pilot |
| "Book accessible rides" | Generate WhatsApp/SMS message for partner |
| "Real-time tracking" | No tracking capability |
| "Across Africa" | Nairobi only |
| "5 service branches" | 1 active, 4 frozen |

**Guiding Principle:** Credibility compounds. Overpromising destroys it.

---

## Step 1: Positioning Options

### Option A: "Mobility Pilot, Vision Teaser"

**What AbiliLife is described as:**
> "A mobility app helping wheelchair users request accessible rides in Nairobi — the first step toward a broader vision of inclusive services."

**Emphasis:**
- AbiliLife Mobility as the current, real product
- Partnership model (works with accessible transport providers)
- Nairobi/Kenya focus
- "First step" / "starting with" language acknowledges larger vision without claiming it's built

**De-emphasized or Removed:**
- Ecosystem section reduced to a brief "Our Vision" note (not a full module showcase)
- Remove specific feature claims (GPS tracking, one-tap booking, trained drivers)
- Remove "super app" terminology from hero
- Remove or heavily caveat "5 Essential Service Branches"

**Risks:**
- May feel small to investors or partners expecting bigger vision
- Could underwhelm visitors who saw previous marketing
- Competitors may appear more ambitious

**Validity Window:**
- Valid through pilot phase (Jan–June 2026 estimated)
- Becomes outdated when/if second module launches or direct dispatch is added

---

### Option B: "Community-First Pilot"

**What AbiliLife is described as:**
> "A community-driven initiative connecting wheelchair users in Nairobi with accessible transport — built with the disability community, for the disability community."

**Emphasis:**
- Community involvement and co-design
- Human connection over technology
- The problem being solved (transport barriers)
- WhatsApp/phone contact as accessible, low-friction entry points
- Team credibility and lived experience connection

**De-emphasized or Removed:**
- App features almost entirely de-emphasized
- Ecosystem section removed or converted to "Future Directions" footnote
- Demo modal potentially removed (or reduced to "see our approach")
- Technical claims minimized

**Risks:**
- May not convey that there IS a working app
- Could feel like an NGO rather than a tech startup
- Investors may question scalability

**Validity Window:**
- Valid indefinitely as a positioning angle
- Would need enhancement once product matures beyond pilot

---

### Option C: "Honest Beta" (Recommended)

**What AbiliLife is described as:**
> "AbiliLife Mobility is an early-stage app helping wheelchair users in Nairobi request accessible rides through our partner network. We're testing, learning, and building — starting with transport, with plans to expand."

**Emphasis:**
- Explicit "beta" / "early-stage" / "pilot" language
- Mobility as the current focus
- Partnership model acknowledged
- Learning/iterating narrative (builds sympathy, manages expectations)
- Clear geographic scope (Kenya/Nairobi)
- Future vision mentioned but clearly labeled as future

**De-emphasized or Removed:**
- "Super app ecosystem" replaced with "long-term vision"
- Ecosystem section reframed as "Roadmap" or "What's Next" (clearly future-tense)
- Feature claims replaced with "what we're testing"
- "5 branches" becomes "starting with mobility, exploring more"

**Risks:**
- "Beta" may deter users who want polished solutions
- Some may perceive as less credible than competitors who overpromise
- Requires ongoing updates as product evolves

**Validity Window:**
- Valid through 2026 pilot phase
- Natural evolution path: "Beta" → "Live" as features prove out

---

## Step 2: CTA Definition

Each positioning option requires a CTA that matches both the message and technical reality.

### Option A CTA: "Request a Ride via WhatsApp"

**Why it fits:**
- Honest about the current flow (WhatsApp message generation)
- Low friction for users
- Doesn't imply in-app dispatch that doesn't exist
- Accessible (WhatsApp is familiar to target audience)

**Button text:** `Request a Ride via WhatsApp`  
**Secondary CTA:** `Learn How It Works`

---

### Option B CTA: "Join Our Community"

**Why it fits:**
- Matches community-first positioning
- Low commitment, high warmth
- Could link to WhatsApp group, newsletter, or contact form
- Doesn't promise product features

**Button text:** `Join Our Community`  
**Secondary CTA:** `Talk to Us`

---

### Option C CTA: "Try the Pilot" (Recommended)

**Why it fits:**
- Explicitly signals early-stage nature
- Invites participation rather than promising service
- Sets expectation of feedback loop
- Honest about product maturity

**Button text:** `Try the Mobility Pilot`  
**Secondary CTA:** `See How It Works` (opens simplified demo or explainer)

**Alternative for Option C:** `Request an Accessible Ride`  
- More action-oriented
- Still honest if the flow is clearly explained on next step
- Risk: may imply direct dispatch; needs careful next-step copy

---

## Step 3: Truth Boundaries

### Allowed Messaging ✅

| Category | Allowed Statements |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Product Scope** | "Starting with accessible mobility in Nairobi" |
| | "Our first module focuses on transport" |
| | "AbiliLife Mobility is in pilot/beta" |
| **Partnership** | "We work with accessible transport providers" |
| | "Built in partnership with mobility services" |
| | "Connecting you with wheelchair-accessible vehicles" |
| **Process** | "Request a ride through our app" |
| | "Share your accessibility needs upfront" |
| | "Your request is sent to our partner network" |
| **Vision** | "Our long-term vision includes..." |
| | "We're exploring healthcare, employment, and education" |
| | "Transport is just the beginning" |
| **Community** | "Built with input from the disability community" |
| | "Designed with wheelchair users in Kenya" |
| | "Community-first approach" |
| **Status** | "We're testing and learning" |
| | "Early-stage pilot" |
| | "Currently available in Nairobi" |

### Not Allowed Messaging ❌

| Category | Prohibited Statements | Why |
|----------|----------------------|-----|
| **Dispatch** | "We dispatch rides directly" | Ace Mobility dispatches |
| | "One-tap booking" | Generates message, not instant dispatch |
| | "Book instantly" | Same as above |
| **Tracking** | "Real-time GPS tracking" | Does not exist |
| | "Track your ride live" | Does not exist |
| | "Arrival notifications" | Not implemented |
| **Drivers** | "Our trained drivers" | Drivers are Ace Mobility's |
| | "AbiliLife drivers" | We don't employ drivers |
| **Scope** | "Super app ecosystem" (as current state) | Only 1 module active |
| | "5 essential service branches" (as active) | 4 are frozen |
| | "Across Africa" | Nairobi only |
| **Features** | "24/7 support" | Unless verified operational |
| | "Emergency SOS button" | Unless verified in pilot |
| | "Voice commands" | Unless verified in pilot |
| **Availability** | "Coming soon to App Store" | Unless timeline confirmed |
| | "Download now" | Unless publicly available |

### Gray Zone (Needs Verification) ⚠️

| Statement | Action Required |
|-----------|-----------------|
| "24/7 support available" | Verify with team if support line is staffed |
| "Ramp-equipped vehicles" | Verify this is true for all Ace Mobility vehicles used |
| Transport statistics (80%, 30%, etc.) | Find/cite source or remove |
| Demo GIFs | Verify they reflect current app state |

---

## Step 4: Section-Level Fate Decisions

### Hero Section

**Decision:** `REFRAME`

**Current state:** "Reimagining Inclusive Services" + "super app ecosystem" + "5 Essential Service Branches"

**Recommended change:**
- Headline: Keep "Reimagining Inclusive Services" OR change to "Accessible Mobility, Starting in Nairobi"
- Subheadline: Remove "super app ecosystem" — replace with pilot-focused language
- Trust indicators: Remove "5 Essential Service Branches" — replace with "Pilot Phase" + "Community-Built"
- CTA: Uncomment and update to match chosen positioning (e.g., "Try the Mobility Pilot")

**Justification:** Hero sets expectations. Current hero overpromises. Reframing is essential.

---

### Ecosystem Section

**Decision:** `MINIMIZE + REFRAME`

**Current state:** Full tree visualization with 5 modules, each with descriptions and status badges

**Recommended change:**
- Convert to "Our Vision" or "What's Next" section
- Reduce to brief paragraph + simple list (not visual tree)
- Explicitly label as "future directions" not "current offerings"
- Move below How It Works (Mobility should come first)
- Consider collapsing into a single "roadmap" card

**Alternative:** `TEMPORARILY REMOVE`
- If team decides future modules shouldn't be mentioned at all during pilot
- Can be restored when second module begins development

**Justification:** The tree visualization implies all branches are growing. They're not. Minimizing prevents false impressions while preserving long-term vision storytelling.

---

### Problem-Solution Section

**Decision:** `KEEP + MINOR REFRAME`

**Current state:** Kenya transport statistics + AbiliLife solution claims

**Recommended changes:**
- Statistics: Keep if sources can be cited; remove or caveat if not
- Solution claims: Remove "one-tap booking," "trained drivers" — keep "accessible ride booking," "community-driven"
- Scope: Ensure language is transport-specific, not ecosystem-wide

**Justification:** Problem framing is strong and relevant. Solution claims need truth alignment but structure works.

---

### How It Works Section

**Decision:** `REFRAME`

**Current state:** 3-step guide implying full ride dispatch, GPS tracking, etc.

**Recommended changes:**
- Step 1 (Preferences): Keep — this is real
- Step 2 (Request): Reframe — "Your request is shared with our partner network" not "book instantly"
- Step 3 (Travel): Remove tracking claims — focus on "board your accessible vehicle" without GPS/notification claims
- Details lists: Audit each item; remove unverified features
- "App Coming soon" note: Verify or remove

**Justification:** This section makes the most specific feature claims. Must be rewritten to match actual pilot capabilities.

---

### Demo Modal

**Decision:** `REFRAME or TEMPORARILY REMOVE`

**Option 1 — Reframe:**
- Verify all GIFs show current app state
- Update section titles to match pilot reality
- Add disclaimer: "Demo shows pilot features; experience may vary"

**Option 2 — Temporarily Remove:**
- If GIFs are outdated or show features that don't exist
- Replace "See Demo" CTA with "Learn How It Works" linking to simplified explainer
- Restore modal when GIFs are updated

**Justification:** Demo modal is high-risk if GIFs misrepresent the product. Verification needed before decision.

---

### Team Section

**Decision:** `KEEP`

**Current state:** 4 co-founders with roles, bios, social links

**Recommended changes:**
- None required for positioning
- Optional: Add "Advisors" or "Community Partners" if relevant
- Ensure bios don't make claims about product that conflict with pilot reality

**Justification:** Team section builds credibility. Human faces and real LinkedIn profiles are trust signals. No changes needed.

---

### Footer Section

**Decision:** `KEEP + FIX ISSUES`

**Current state:** Contact info, social links, quick links, copyright

**Required fixes:**
- Fix typo: "Bsck to Top" → "Back to Top"
- Update copyright: "© 2025" → "© 2026"
- Fix broken link: Quick Links "How It Works" should point to `#how-it-works`
- Optional: Remove or verify "24/7 Emergency Support" if it appears anywhere

**Justification:** Footer is functional but has bugs. Fixes are low-risk maintenance.

---

## Next Steps (Phase 3 Prerequisites)

Before implementation, confirm:

1. [ ] **CTA destination:** Where does "Try the Mobility Pilot" link? (WhatsApp? App store? Waitlist form?)
2. [ ] **GIF verification:** Are demo GIFs current? (Yes → reframe modal; No → remove modal)
3. [ ] **Statistics sources:** Can transport statistics be cited? (Yes → keep; No → remove)
4. [ ] **24/7 support:** Is support line operational? (Yes → keep claim; No → remove)
5. [ ] **Ace Mobility mention:** Should partner be named explicitly? (Founder decision)
6. [ ] **Ecosystem fate:** Minimize to "Vision" section or remove entirely? (Founder decision)
