## Content Principles

### 1. Clarity Over Cleverness
Say what we mean. No jargon, no buzzwords, no "reimagining" or "ecosystem" language.

### 2. Honest About Status
Distinguish between:
- **Available now:** AbiliLife Mobility pilot in Nairobi
- **Coming later:** Care, Work, Access, Learn modules

### 3. Mission-Led, Not Feature-Led
Lead with purpose, not feature lists. Why we exist matters more than what buttons we have.

### 4. Grounded in Place
We are in Nairobi, Kenya. Not "across Africa" (yet). Specificity builds credibility.

### 5. Human Voice
Write like a person explaining to a friend, not a company writing marketing copy.

```
The Problem
```

**Body Copy:**
```
For wheelchair users in Nairobi, getting around is a daily challenge.

Most matatus aren't accessible. Taxis are expensive and unreliable. And asking for help every time isn't dignity — it's dependency.

We believe transport should be available to everyone.

Share your wheelchair type, pickup preferences, and any assistance you need. We save this so you don't repeat it.
```

**Step 2:**
```
Request a ride
Send us your pickup and drop-off locations. We connect you with a partner vehicle.
```

**Step 3:**
```
Travel with support
Board your wheelchair-accessible vehicle. Share trip details with caregivers via the app.
